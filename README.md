# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains the project files for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions, focusing on data analysis, version control, and modeling to enhance insurance solutions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

1. **Create a Git Repository**
   - Initialize a Git repository for the project.
   - Ensure version control is set up to manage changes.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD workflows.

3. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Data Summarization:** Summarize key statistics and data distributions.
   - **Data Quality Assessment:** Evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the data.
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution.
   - **Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between two or more variables.
   - **Data Comparison:** Compare data across different segments or time periods.
   - **Outlier Detection:** Identify and analyze outliers in the data.
   - **Visualization:** Create visualizations to represent data insights and trends.

### Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)

1. **Install Data Version Control (DVC)**
   - Install DVC for managing data versions.

2. **Initialize DVC**
   - Initialize DVC in the project directory.

3. **Set Up Local Remote Storage**
   - Configure local remote storage for DVC.

4. **Track Datasets with DVC**
   - Place datasets into the project directory and use DVC to track them.

5. **Commit and Push Data**
   - Commit changes to version control.
   - Push data to the local remote storage.

### Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing

1. **Select Metrics**
   - Choose the key performance indicator (KPI) to measure the impact of features being tested.

2. **Data Segmentation**
   - **Group A (Control Group):** Plans without the feature.
   - **Group B (Test Group):** Plans with the feature.

3. **Statistical Testing**
   - Conduct appropriate statistical tests.
   - Analyze the p-value to determine significance.
   - Report the findings from the statistical test.

### Task 4: Modeling Techniques

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Handling Missing Data:** Impute or remove missing values as needed based on their nature and quantity.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Create new features relevant to `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`.
   - **Encoding Categorical Data:** Convert categorical data into numeric format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - **Train-Test Split:** Split the data into training and test sets, typically using a 70:30 or 80:20 ratio.

2. **Model Building**
   - **Linear Regression:** Implement a linear regression model to predict outcomes based on the features.
   - **Decision Trees:** Build decision tree models to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
   - **Random Forests:** Apply random forest techniques to improve prediction accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.
   - **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs):** Utilize XGBoost for advanced modeling to enhance predictive performance through boosting techniques.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine performance.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - **Feature Importance:** Analyze which features are most influential in predicting outcomes.
   - **Model Interpretation:** Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret model predictions and understand feature impacts.

5. **Report Comparison**
   - **Model Performance Comparison:** Compare the performance of each model and provide a detailed report on their effectiveness.
